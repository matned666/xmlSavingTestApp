# XML Loading test App

A simple application made in JavaFX<br>
that loads and saves data from/to an .xml file<br>
This is a simple employees list, where you can add and modify them.<br>

## Structure?

- FXML file and constructor - simple as hell
- xml models for EmployeesList, Employee and Achievement
- read and save static methods in EmployeesXMLReader
- For XML read and save I use javax lib

### Missing options:
All the missing options such as removal , adding new picture and achievements<br>
were not given because this is just a sample app. <br>
If you'd like to have them... feel free to fork the project<br>
